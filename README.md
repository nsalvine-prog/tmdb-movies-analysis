# tmdb-movies-analysis
Data analysis of TMDB Movies dataset using Python.

## Introduction

This project is my first data analysis work completed during the Udacity Data Analyst Program. The goal was to explore real-world movie data and investigate key relationships within the TMDB Movies Dataset. Specifically, I examined whether voting average affects adjusted revenue, how many movies were released over time, and whether movie popularity influences revenue performance.

## Data Description

The objective of this project is to analyze a large movie dataset using Python. The dataset contains over 10,000 movies and includes 21 variables, such as:

id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage,
director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genre,
production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average,
release_year, budget_adj, and revenue_adj.

For the analysis, I used a cleaned sample of 5,000 movies.
The dependent variable in this study is adjusted revenue, while the key independent variables include:

Vote average

Popularity

Release year

These variables were selected to help determine which movie features influence financial performance.
